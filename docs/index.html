                As the SW & Vision AI Team Leader, I have developed a computer vision AI solution for the new InBody Scale AI product. This involved researching and enhancing the performance of height estimation algorithms using a low-performance monocular camera and limited computing resources. Additionally, I developed a face verification solution, along with the necessary pipeline and database for it.

                Existing height estimation algorithms and papers using vision assume that the user's entire body is within the camera's field of view. However, due to the mechanical characteristics of the InBody device, the user's full body does not fit within the camera's field of view. Our attempt to estimate height under these conditions is unprecedented. In our first experiment, we achieved an average error of 0.6% and a maximum error of 1%. We tackled the ultimate problem of height estimation by breaking it down into sub-problems where computer vision AI can excel: Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation. To achieve this, we designed and utilized a structure that allows the camera to move via motors and rails.

            <h2>Product description</h2>
            <div>
                InBody AI scale reduces the speed of existing body composition analyzers by less than
                half and automatically measures and inputs all information required for body
                composition analysis. This allows users to conveniently measure as if they were stepping
                on a scale, and makes body composition measurement a natural part of daily life. It is
                the world's first all-in-one body composition analyzer that maximizes user convenience
                in the measurement process through AI and an improved electrode system, and also
                provides detailed comparison values and AI-tailored health services through big data.
            </div>
            <br>
            <h2>Engineering</h2>
            <div>
                The InBody AI scale is the world's first AI body composition analyzer to completely
                eliminate the inconvenience of manual input by automatically entering all essential
                information through AI.
                The AI camera moving through the vertical linear structure is equipped with the self-
                developed Eye 2 Height Algorithm(E2H Algorithm) based on HOG detector model and
                CNN predictor model, and it measures the eye level within 0.2 inches of error through
                more than 3,000 user data and automatically calculates the height. The AI face
                recognition implemented as a deep-face model automatically inputs user information
                and completes the measurement within 30 seconds without stopping. Afterward,
                detailed age-based comparisons and AI-customized health information services are
                provided using 100 million data points stored in the InBody cloud.
                Since body composition analysis is performed by transmitting microcurrents into the
                cells, no current flows when wearing socks. However, this product measures the contact
                resistance of the feet through its own Hydrating Conductive System(HCS), calculates
                the presence and thickness of socks, and supplies as much moisture as necessary for electrical conduction. By applying the peristaltic pump of the hemodialysis device, fine
                supply is possible and measurement is possible without harming the user experience.

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <div>
                The InBody AI scale helps people of various body types around the world, including
                specialized body types, maintain a natural and comfortable posture with an
                automatically adjusted display that follows the user's gaze and an ergonomically
                designed electrode handle and footrest.
                The sturdy and wide footrest and the long stroke in the height meter allow people from
                children as tall as 4.2ft to people as tall as 6.6ft to easily climb onto the device and
                measure without any burden. The upper body of the device, which is equipped with a
                low-noise BLDC motor and linear rail, minimizes the movement noise of the display to
                the extreme, maintaining a high user experience.
                The clean and simple UI design that does not require any input eases the user’s
                concerns and tension regarding the medical data analysis process of body composition
                measurement. It is mainly composed of 3D images and videos, which leads to a high
                level of user understanding and stable posture for using the device, and it is easy for
                people with language difficulties or disabilities to use it.
